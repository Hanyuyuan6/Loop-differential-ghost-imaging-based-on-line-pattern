# Loop-differential-ghost-imaging-based-on-line-pattern
The code delves into the pattern characteristics of optical phased arrays (OPAs) based on PICs and identifies a limitation in traditional GI denoising algorithms when employing line pattern illumination field generated by one dimensional OPA (1D OPA) with grating waveguide (GW), attributed to noise symmetry disruption.
